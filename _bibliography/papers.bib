  abstract    = {In today's fast-paced world, many turn to social media to express emotions, often unaware of their mental health struggles. Using machine learning, this approach analyzes social media posts to detect emotions through polarity (sentiment strength) and subjectivity (personal views). By identifying positive or negative sentiments, it aims to diagnose mental health conditions early and enable timely interventions.},
