Hello! I'm Sovit Nayak, a passionate and results-driven Data Scientist with a strong foundation in data engineering, machine learning, and data visualization. I’m currently pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science (Statistics) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where I’ve honed my skills in solving complex problems using cutting-edge technologies. With a 3.8 GPA and a strong academic foundation, I am set to graduate in December 2024.

Over the course of my career, I’ve gained 2+ years of professional experience working with diverse industries, including Product Development, finance, and technology, where I’ve developed scalable ETL pipelines, implemented AI/ML models, and optimized large-scale datasets. I’ve successfully built and deployed machine learning models to solve business challenges such as fraud detection, risk assessment, and predictive analytics, delivering measurable value to stakeholders.

I thrive in leveraging technologies such as Python, SQL, Apache Spark, kafka, Snowflake, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and AWS, and I specialize in unstructured data analysis, NLP, and big data processing. My professional journey has equipped me with expertise in designing end-to-end data pipelines, deploying AI/ML solutions, and creating intuitive dashboards using Tableau and Power BI, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions with confidence.

Beyond technical skills, I excel at data storytelling, combining analytical rigor with compelling visualizations to translate complex insights into actionable strategies. My collaborative mindset has allowed me to work effectively with cross-functional teams, contributing to projects that resulted in 10-15% performance improvements across various domains.

I’m passionate about exploring innovative AI technologies and staying ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving data science landscape. Whether it’s designing algorithms for real-time analytics, optimizing data workflows, or mentoring peers, I am dedicated to creating impactful solutions.
